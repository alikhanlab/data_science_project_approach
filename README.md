# Data Science Project Approach

# Data Science Project Work Flow. Sequence is important.

To view it with images, please download repository as '.zip'. Because in '.pynb' on github does not show images.

0. Read `practical_guides` folder and follow pipeline there.

1. Read from `ml_algorithms` folder, to recap ml algorithms.

2. Read and Implement from `preprocessing_and_feature_engineering` folder to clean data, deal with missing data, basic feaeture engineering from text, image.

3. EDA is important to get sense of data. Read and Implement EDA from `eda` folder.

4. Validate and split your data right. Do not overfit, check with plot. Read and implement `validation` folder.

5. Constract baseline for every metric(evaluation metric) to know how well you performing versus constant model. If not better than baseline, then model is bad. Read and implement `metrics_optimization` folder.

6. Perform advanced feature engineering from `advanced_feature_engineering` folder.

7. Perform hyperparameter tuning on `hyperparameter_tuning` folder. Do not spend too much time here. 

8. Always save your models after youn tune them.

9. Always perform ensembling from `ensembling` folder.
