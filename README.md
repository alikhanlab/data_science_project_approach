# Data Science Project Approach

# Data Science Project Work Flow. Sequence is important.

1. Read from 'ml_algorithms' folder, to recap ml algorithms.

2. Read and Implement from 'preprocessing_and_feature_engineering' folder to clean data, deal with missing data, basic feaeture engineering from text, image.

3. EDA is important to get sense of data. Read and Implement EDA from 'eda' folder.

4. Validate and split your data right. Do not overfit, check with plot. Read and implement 'validation' folder.

5. Constract baseline for every metric(evaluation metric) to know how well you performing versus constant model. If not better than baseline, then model is bad. Read and implement 'metrics_optimization' folder.
